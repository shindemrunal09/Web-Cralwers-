Simple and Multi threaded web crawlers 
This project focuses on two types of crawling methods, simple crawling method and multi-threading crawling. In a time period of one minute the multithreaded crawler fetches 426 links whereas the simple crawler fetches 249 sites. Due to high consumption of bandwidth the depth of crawling is only restricted to one level. Comparatively multi-threaded crawlers were considered the advanced crawlers as they could go through various links and print the URLs at the same time simultaneously.
